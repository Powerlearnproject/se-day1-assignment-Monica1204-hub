# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering the the process of developing ,testing & mainatining of software application systems.
Software developers develop software systems fir business owners where they track their business growth & work flow.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developing - The assembling of systems to create a whole software.
Maitaining - running through to ensure the software has no problems or incapabilities
Updating- releasing it to the final consumer .


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Problem analysis- learning the nature of the project so as to know which software best suites iit.
Planning - Deciding on the type of software to develop to best handle the problem identified.
Designing - adding features & elements of software to develop.
Test- running through to identify any underkying problems & bugs in the software 
Deplyoment -releasing the software to the final consumer

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is used in stable inflexible projects while Agile methodology is used in prohects likely to make changes after time.
Crypto currency systems are most likely to use Waterfall methodologies for there are no likely major changes in the business system except system uogrades or maintenace.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible of coding & developing a software.
Quality Assuarance Engineer identifies ,analayses & docunents the software problems 
Project manager oversee the development process to completion & deploys the software when complete.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They simply guve rights in a system for tge develiper to track changes, make changes & merge codes efficiently.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technological advancement 
Cyber crimes
limited infrastructure
this problems can be solved through 
leveranging with technology by continous learning & device updates & upgrading
putting in place proactive measures that help curb cyber relates crimes.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing -this is testing whether the components of the software are fit for the intended functions.
Intergration testing- verifies data flow from one component to the other.
System testing - testing & identifying whether the system has any bugs 
 Acceptance testing - here is the making of the decision of whther to deploy the software or not.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
providing clear,simple & specific instructions to an A.I to receive relevant & particular responses from it.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
wonders of the world 
Providing accurate locations explain briefly the 7 wonders of the world.
its giving exact & precise information of the worders of the world
